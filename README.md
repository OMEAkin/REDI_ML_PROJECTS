ImmoScout24 is one of Germany’s leading real estate platforms, offering extensive listings for apartments, houses, and commercial properties nationwide. The company’s team of data analysts and data scientists actively examine market data to identify trends and insights. Among the markets it covers, Berlin receives particular attention due to its dynamic housing landscape. In this data science project, we investigate and analyze rental apartments across the various regions of Berlin.
